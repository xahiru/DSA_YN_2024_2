1. Write a C program to implement a queue using an array. 
Programs should contain functions for inserting elements into the queue, 
displaying queue elements, and checking whether the queue is empty or not.
Expected Output:

Initialize a queue!
Check the queue is empty or not? Yes

Insert some elements into the queue:
Queue elements are: 1 2 3 

Insert another element into the queue:
Queue elements are: 1 2 3 4 

Check the queue is empty or not? No


2. Write a C program to implement a queue using an array. 
Create a function that removes an element from the queue.
Expected Output:

Initialize a queue!
Insert some elements into the queue:
Queue elements are: 1 2 3 

Delete an element from the said queue:
Queue elements are: 2 3 

Insert another element into the queue:
Queue elements are: 2 3 4

3. Write a C program to implement a queue using a linked list. 
Programs should contain functions for inserting elements into the queue, displaying queue elements, and checking whether the queue is empty or not.
Expected Output:

Initialize a queue!
Check the queue is empty or not? Yes

Insert some elements into the queue:
1 2 3 

Insert another element into the queue:
1 2 3 4 

Check the queue is empty or not? No



6. Write a C program to reverse the elements of a queue.
Expected Output:

Queue elements are:
1 2 3 4 5
Reverse Queue, elements are:
5 4 3 2 1
Add two elements to the said queue:
Queue elements are:
5 4 3 2 1 100 200
Reverse Queue, elements are:
200 100 1 2 3 4 5



7. Write a C program to calculate the sum of the elements in a queue.
Expected Output:

Queue elements are: 1 2 3 4 5 
Sum of the elements in the queue is: 15

Remove 2 elements from the said queue:
Queue elements are: 3 4 5 
Sum of the elements in the queue is: 12

Insert 3 more elements:
Queue elements are: 3 4 5 300 400 500 
Sum of the elements in the queue is: 1212


9. Write a C program to find the maximum element in a queue.
Expected Output:

Queue elements are: 1 2 3 4 5 
Maximum value in the queue is: 5

Remove 2 elements from the said queue:
Queue elements are: 3 4 5 
Maximum value in the queue is: 5

Insert 3 more elements:
Queue elements are: 3 4 5 600 427 519 
Maximum value in the queue is: 600


11. Write a C program to delete the nth element of a queue.
Firstly, this code checks if the queue is empty or if the position to 
delete is invalid. If the position is valid, it deletes the first n-1 elements, then deletes the nth element by calling the dequeue() function.

Expected Output:

Insert some elements into the queue:
Queue elements are: 1 2 3 4 5

Delete the 7th element of the said queue:
Error: Invalid position

Delete the 3rd element of the said queue:
Queue elements are: 4 5

12. Write a C program to sort the elements of a queue in ascending order.
Expected Output:

Input some elements into the queue:
Elements of the queue:
4 2 7 5 1 

Sort the said queue:
Elements of the sorted queue in ascending order:
1 2 4 5 7 

Input two more elements into the queue:
Elements of the queue:
1 2 4 5 7 -1 3 

Sort the said queue:
Elements of the sorted queue in ascending order:
-1 1 2 3 4 5 7
